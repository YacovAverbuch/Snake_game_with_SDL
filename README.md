# Snake game using SDL library

I took the eccelent tour for SDL with the playlist of 'lets make gakes'
https://www.youtube.com/user/creaper/featured

I used the dinamic libraries of SDL so in order to use the executable, the OS has to recognise
the directory of those libraries as source directory.
